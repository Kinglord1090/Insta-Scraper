# Insta-Scraper ðŸ“¸

Insta-Scraper is a tool designed to quickly extract information from public Instagram profiles, such as the user-provided name, number of posts, followers, following count, and profile description. This tool uses Selenium to automate the data extraction process, making it useful for gathering insights about public profiles efficiently.

## Features

- **Automated Data Extraction**: Uses Selenium to log in and fetch information from Instagram profiles automatically.
- **Profile Information Retrieval**: Extracts name, post count, followers, following count, and bio description of the target profile.
- **Headless Mode**: Operates in headless mode for efficiency and to avoid UI interruptions during scraping.
- **Error Handling**: Implements basic error handling for cases where elements might not be found.
- **Privacy Focused**: Does not save or transmit login details locally or over the internet.
- **Extensible Codebase**: Code is structured for easy modifications and additional features.
